# Contributing

First of all, thanks for contributing! This is a very early stage project and we are happy to have contributors.

This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing to this repository.
To propose improvements, feel free to submit a PR.

## Submitting issues

* If you have a feature request or found a bug feel free to open a Github issue.

## Pull Requests

Have you fixed a bug or written a new integration/feature and want to share it? Thank you so much.

In order to ease/speed up our review, here are some items you can check/improve
when submitting your PR:

* Write tests for the code you wrote (I know, we don't have much right now, we're working on it as we test the idea, but a few help).
* Make sure that all tests pass locally.
* Summarize your PR with a meaningful title, [see later on this doc](#pull-request-title).

### Keep it small, focused

Avoid changing too many things at once. 

### Pull Request title

Unless the PR is marked with the proper exclusion label, the title will be used
to automatically fill the changelog entries. For this reason the title must be
concise but explanatory.

### Commit Messages

Take a moment to write meaningful commit messages.

The commit message should describe the reason for the change and give extra details
that will allow someone later on to understand in 5 seconds the thing you've been
working on for a day.
